# IR Sensor with Arduino Uno R3 â€“ LED Demonstration

This repository contains the Arduino code and circuit details for **demonstrating the working of an Infrared (IR) Sensor** with an **Arduino Uno R3** and an **LED** indicator.

The main purpose of this project is to help beginners understand **how an IR sensor detects objects** and how the Arduino processes the sensorâ€™s signal to control an LED. The IR sensor works by emitting infrared light and checking if that light is reflected back by an object. When an object comes close, the sensor sends a signal to the Arduino, and the Arduino turns the LED **ON**. When there is no object, the LED stays **OFF**.

This setup is a great starting point for learning about sensors, Arduino programming, and basic electronics. The code is fully commented, so you can easily follow along and understand how each part works. A simple wiring diagram is also provided so you can quickly connect the components without confusion.
